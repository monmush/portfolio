          üëã I was born in Hanoi, Vietnam. After finishing high school, I moved
          to Finland to pursue a Bachelor of Engineering, specializing in
          Information Technology. My major was Computer Networking, but in my
          fourth year, I discovered a passion for programming and web
          development. Since then, I have been mostly self-taught, constantly
          learning new technologies and honing my skills.

          This was a significant highlight in my career. I was one of the first
          employees, joining the team when there were only two of us, excluding
          the board of directors. I contributed some of the first lines of code
          and primarily handled the Frontend development. Over two years, I had
          numerous opportunities to learn and create exciting products. The
          company grew tenfold during my tenure, evolving into a much larger and
          more dynamic team.
