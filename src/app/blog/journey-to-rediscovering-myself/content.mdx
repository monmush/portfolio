At Inspectorio, I had the privilege of working in a highly professional environment that emphasized respect, kindness, and a well-organized process. We enjoyed the freedom to express our thoughts and choose our working spaces. Everything seemed perfect, but deep down, I felt something was off.

I struggled to follow my career development plan, finding it challenging to stick to the goals I set for myself. Initially, I thought this was a personal flaw. However, after spending some time traveling through the mountains of northern Vietnam with a close friend, I took a step back to reflect on my experiences. I realized that my character might simply be different; I tend to be emotionally driven and often make impulsive decisions. While this doesn't apply to every choice I make, I often feel more fulfilled when I follow my instincts.

For instance, when learning new technologies, I find it difficult to adhere to a structured course. I might immerse myself in study, then lose interest and drift away, only to return later—or not at all. My learning path resembles a fluctuating wave rather than a straight line. Even though I learned a lot during my time at Inspectorio, I felt like I wasn’t making significant progress on my career development goals.

It’s crucial for me to understand myself to find true fulfillment. In today’s world, social media bombards us with suggestions on how to live our lives, what the standards should be, and what goals everyone should strive for. However, I believe these generalized expectations often miss the mark. Success and the standard of living should be defined on an individual level. By gaining insight into my own character, strengths, and desires, I can create a path that resonates with who I am, leading to a more fulfilling and authentic life. Understanding myself allows me to navigate life’s complexities in a way that aligns with my values and aspirations, rather than conforming to external pressures.

Having achieved a comfortable lifestyle, I began asking myself: what do I truly want from life? What values do I wish to uphold beyond financial gain? This reflection helped me gain awareness of my character and the importance of pursuing activities that fulfill me. I want to take the time to ask myself essential questions: Who am I? What do I enjoy? What do I dislike? How can I find fulfillment in my next job?

These questions are vital, especially after five years of continuous work, during which I began to forget why I pursued this career in the first place. I had focused primarily on financial success, often blaming myself for not meeting industry expectations because they didn’t align with my character.

Now, I’m ready to stop sleepwalking through life and start being more aware of my actions. I want to spend this valuable time rediscovering myself and my purpose. I believe that through this process, I will return stronger—whether in engineering or perhaps even in a new career path entirely.

Taking this break is not just a pause; it's an opportunity to explore who I am and what I genuinely want from life. I look forward to this journey of self-discovery and the possibilities it will bring.
