In today's world, social media constantly bombards us with images of what success should look like: career milestones, financial gains, and personal achievements. We're often told what goals to chase and how to live our lives. But I’ve come to realize that these generalized standards often miss the mark. True success and fulfillment are deeply personal and cannot be defined by someone else's expectations.

For me, it's become crucial to understand who I am at my core in order to find real fulfillment. By gaining insight into my character, strengths, and desires, I can carve a path that resonates with who I truly am. This allows me to navigate life in a way that aligns with my values and aspirations, rather than conforming to external pressures. When I live authentically, I experience more joy and purpose in everything I do.

## The Reflective Pause: Learning About Myself

Having achieved a comfortable lifestyle, I began to ask myself some important questions: What do I truly want from life? What values do I want to uphold beyond financial gain? This reflection helped me gain awareness of my character and the importance of pursuing activities that fulfill me on a deeper level. I realized it’s not enough to just achieve material success—I also need to find personal fulfillment.

At Inspectorio, I had the privilege of working in a highly professional environment that emphasized respect, kindness, and a well-organized process. We enjoyed the freedom to express our thoughts and choose our working spaces. On the surface, everything seemed perfect. But deep down, something felt off.

After some reflection, I recognized that my personality might simply be different from the environment around me. I tend to be emotionally driven and often make decisions based on my gut feelings. While this doesn’t apply to every aspect of my life, I generally feel more fulfilled when I follow my instincts.

For instance, I’ve found that I have a hard time sticking to rigid plans, whether it's a personal development plan or a long online tech course. I might immerse myself fully into studying for a while, then lose interest and drift away, sometimes returning later—or not at all. My learning path is more of a fluctuating wave than a straight line. Despite learning a lot during my time at Inspectorio, I didn’t feel I was making significant progress toward my long-term career goals.

## The Value of Embracing Change

On the flip side, I’ve learned that my impulsiveness and emotional decision-making can be strengths in certain situations. I love taking on new challenges and feel energized by making impactful changes that benefit others. For example, I find great satisfaction in creating tools that enhance the developer experience, making workflows smoother and more efficient. It’s in these moments of innovation and collaboration that I feel truly fulfilled.

This self-awareness has shown me that it's okay to question what I’m doing and to consider different paths. It’s about understanding who I am, what I enjoy, and how I can align my work with those passions.

## A New Beginning: The Search for Fulfillment

Now, after five years of continuous work, I’ve realized that I was beginning to lose sight of why I pursued my career in the first place. I had become too focused on meeting industry expectations and financial goals—goals that didn’t necessarily align with my true character. It’s easy to fall into the trap of sleepwalking through life, but I’m ready to wake up, take control, and be more aware of my actions.

This is why I’ve decided to take a break—not just to rest, but to rediscover myself and my purpose. I want to use this time to ask myself important questions: Who am I? What do I enjoy? What do I dislike? How can I find fulfillment in my next job? These are not easy questions, but they are essential to finding a path that feels right for me.

This break is not just a pause in my career; it’s an opportunity to reflect on who I am and what I genuinely want from life. It’s a chance to explore new possibilities, whether that means returning to engineering with a fresh perspective or perhaps venturing into a new field altogether.

I look forward to this journey of self-discovery and to seeing where it leads me. With a clearer understanding of myself, I believe I’ll return stronger, more fulfilled, and ready to take on whatever challenges lie ahead.
