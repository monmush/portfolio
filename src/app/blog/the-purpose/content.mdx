**The purpose of life.** What a big question! Many have discussed it in books, podcasts, and YouTube videos, yet a surprising number of people still feel lost, searching for answers. Today, I feel compelled to take a moment and reflect on it for myself. Rather than diving into a method or following a step-by-step guide to finding purpose, I want to approach it more organically—by talking to myself, perhaps through writing like this.

But first, **what is purpose?** And how does it differ from a goal? Is purpose just a grander concept that encapsulates multiple goals? I suppose it could be, but for me, the definition is more nuanced. Here’s what purpose means to me, and how I distinguish it from other pursuits in life:

### What Purpose Is — And Isn’t

1. **Purpose is not material.** It’s not about accumulating wealth or owning things. Money, cars, houses—these are tools or stepping stones, not the destination. For me, purpose is never about acquiring objects but about pursuing something that resonates deeply on an emotional and spiritual level.
2. **Purpose is distinct from general responsibilities.** As human beings, we have certain roles and duties: caring for ourselves, supporting our parents, and nurturing our children. These are universal responsibilities we take on, regardless of our personal purpose. Some people find their purpose in family, and that’s beautiful. But for the sake of this discussion, let’s set aside the common duties that everyone shoulders.
3. **Purpose is something I’m willing to sacrifice for.** It should be something I would pursue wholeheartedly, even if there’s no recognition, no applause, and no external reward. It’s about aligning with something that satisfies a core need within, regardless of external gains.
4. **Purpose is dynamic.** It’s not a fixed point we discover once and cling to forever. What drives us in one phase of life might shift and evolve as we grow, experience new things, and develop different priorities. This fluidity is a reminder to stay open-minded and receptive to changes.

### The Core Question: Do We Even Need a Purpose?

Before delving deeper, a critical question emerges: **Do we even need a purpose?** Can’t we simply live our lives, savoring the present moment without chasing some grand idea? Why do I feel the need for a purpose at all?

I often hear people say, _“If you don’t know your purpose, you’ll end up working for someone else’s.”_ That statement evokes a fear of missing out—a sense that if I don’t hurry to define my path, I might get swept along in the currents of someone else’s dream.

But that’s not the kind of purpose I’m searching for. I’m not looking for a target to work toward. Instead, I want to find something that **I would do willingly, even if there were no external expectations or returns**. Why? Because I feel adrift. Lately, I haven’t felt much motivation. I don’t want to just float along. I want to engage with life in a meaningful way, and perhaps rediscovering my purpose will help reignite that connection.

### Understanding What I Love and What I Dislike

Before I can pinpoint what truly drives me, it’s essential to clarify what I naturally gravitate toward and what I find draining or unfulfilling. Identifying these feelings can reveal patterns and themes that shape my sense of purpose.

**Things I dislike:**

- Blazing hot days
- Polluted air and environmental damage
- Anger and hostility
- Cruelty towards animals
- Superficial or disconnected relationships
- Repetitive, unchallenging tasks
- Complex, illogical processes
- Anxiety and self-doubt
- Pretending to be someone I’m not
- Busywork that lacks meaning or impact
- Loneliness and isolation
- A sense of emptiness or lack of purpose
- Harsh noise and chaotic environments
- Being unjustly blamed or criticized
- Verbal attacks or conflicts

**Things I love:**

- The serenity of nature and beautiful landscapes
- Connecting with animals
- Gentle, breezy sunny days
- Enjoying a well-crafted drink — be it coffee, tea, a cocktail, or a good beer
- The relaxation and satisfaction after playing sports
- A soothing head and shoulder massage
- Quiet moments of self-reflection
- Delicious food, especially Asian cuisine
- Driving a car that handles well
- Acts of kindness — given and received
- Genuine care and thoughtfulness
- Calm, peaceful environments
- Listening to music that tells a story or has a captivating rhythm
- Well-designed spaces and objects
- Capturing meaningful moments through photography
- Sharing quality time with loved ones: my wife, parents, and close friends
- The joy of comedy and good humor
- Immersing myself in a powerful play or movie
- Gaming sessions with friends that foster camaraderie and fun

By recognizing these likes and dislikes, I can see more clearly the themes that resonate with me—a desire for **harmony, creativity, authentic relationships**, and **meaningful engagement**. This clarity will help guide my pursuit of a purpose that aligns with who I truly am.

### What Does It Look Like?

When I step back and reflect on my loves and dislikes, clear themes emerge: a desire for **authentic connections**, an appreciation for **creativity and beauty**, and a sensitivity to **environmental harmony and peace**. I’m drawn to nature, genuine relationships, and meaningful moments, while I’m repelled by chaos, disconnection, and emptiness.

These insights, combined with my strengths in **photography, programming, and product design**, guide me toward a few areas worth exploring:

1. **Creating Meaningful Digital Experiences**: Building products that bring people together, foster genuine connections, or promote mental well-being—perhaps through a blend of interactive media, personal development tools, or social platforms designed for more authentic interactions.
2. **Environmental Tech and Storytelling**: Merging my love for photography and the natural world with technology to craft visual stories, build awareness, or develop tools that contribute to environmental causes. This could mean working on projects that highlight environmental beauty, reduce pollution, or promote sustainable living.
3. **Creative Arts and Technology**: Working on projects that blend design, art, and programming to create visually compelling experiences. Whether it’s through digital media, interactive art, or tech-driven storytelling, I want to bring creativity and beauty into people's lives.
4. **Purpose-Driven Tech Development**: Building software or tools that solve real problems for people, simplify complex processes, or help others find calm and focus in the noise of everyday life. I want to contribute to something that feels **human** and impactful, rather than just building another business tool.

### Looking Ahead: A New Path to Explore

By reflecting on what I love, what I dislike, and where my skills lie, I’ve gained more clarity on my own sense of purpose. While I don’t have everything figured out, this exploration has provided me with a compass to guide my next steps.

With time left in my career break, I’m eager to dive into these new areas—whether it’s creating meaningful digital experiences, working on environmental storytelling, or blending art and technology. I hope this journey will help me rediscover what it means to feel truly connected and fulfilled.

Purpose, after all, isn’t about finding a single, unchanging destination. It’s about exploring, evolving, and choosing to engage with what genuinely resonates.
