After leaving my last job, I set a mission for myself. I wanted to use this valuable time to step back, reflect, and explore who I am. During high school, I rarely had the chance or guidance to truly understand myself—to recognize my strengths and weaknesses. The hard truth is that, at that time, most of us were focused solely on learning anything that could help us get a well-paying job. Money was a huge goal that we were all chasing.

However, after five years of continuous hard work (at my peak, I worked on four jobs at the same time—three of them were part-time or contractor work), I achieved a comfortable lifestyle and a decent income, especially when compared to the average living standard in Vietnam.

I started to look at myself and wonder: why did I choose the job I do now? To be honest, I had absolutely no idea. Perhaps I was just doing it for the money.

Don’t get me wrong—I love being an engineer sometimes. I love the ability to create new products that make life better, all from a computer. It’s a unique ability we’ve never had before. But recently, I realized that I’ve sadly been doing it just for the money. I don’t see anything else.

## Understanding Myself

So now, I want to understand myself better. Who am I? What type of personality or character do I have? Why do I feel good or bad during certain times at work? My wife suggested that I take a personality test. I spent some time taking the test [here](https://www.16personalities.com/).

The result was quite impressive. I would say it accurately described me. There are things I used to blame myself for—such as my inability to stick to a rigid plan. It turns out that it might just be part of my natural characteristics rather than a personal failing. I began to understand, accept, and be kinder to myself.

According to the 16 Personalities test, I am an Adventurer (ISFP).

## The Adventurer's Approach to Planning

As an Adventurer, I've come to realize that long-term planning doesn't always come naturally to me. We ISFPs often find ourselves living in the moment, which can be both a blessing and a challenge. While this spontaneity allows us to fully embrace life's experiences, it can sometimes leave us without a clear vision or plan to achieve our goals.

I've noticed that I tend to approach tasks and projects with a flexible, adaptable mindset. This can be great for creative endeavors, but it can also make it difficult to stick to rigid schedules or long-term commitments. However, I've learned that by incorporating some structure into my life, I can greatly benefit from a balance between flexibility and organization.

For example, I've started using simple planning tools and setting short-term goals to help me stay on track without feeling overwhelmed by distant future plans. This approach allows me to maintain my spontaneous nature while still making progress towards my larger objectives.

## Lifestyle and Friendships

As an Adventurer, my lifestyle is characterized by a love for new experiences and a desire for authenticity. I find myself drawn to activities that allow me to express my creativity and engage my senses. Whether it's trying out a new hobby, exploring nature, or immersing myself in art and music, I'm always eager to discover new facets of life.

When it comes to friendships, I value deep, meaningful connections over large social circles. As an ISFP, I tend to be warm and caring, but also fiercely independent. My friends appreciate my ability to listen without judgment and my willingness to offer support when needed. I enjoy spending time with like-minded individuals who share my passion for exploration and creativity.

However, my introverted nature means that I also need plenty of alone time to recharge. I've learned to balance my social life with periods of solitude, which allows me to maintain strong friendships without feeling drained.

## The Adventurer at Work

In the workplace, my Adventurer personality truly shines through. I thrive in environments that offer freedom and flexibility, allowing me to approach tasks in my own unique way. Routine and repetitive work can quickly become stifling for me, as I crave variety and the opportunity to express my creativity.

As an ISFP, I have a strong desire for autonomy in my work. I value the freedom to speak my mind, choose my workplace, and contribute to projects that I believe will make a meaningful impact. This doesn't mean I'm not a team player – in fact, I enjoy collaborating with others when our goals align. However, I perform best when given the space to work independently and bring my own ideas to the table.

When it comes to management roles, Adventurers like myself may face some challenges. Our dislike for rigid structures and preference for flexibility can make it difficult to enforce strict rules or deadlines. However, we can excel as leaders by fostering a creative, supportive environment that encourages individual expression and innovation.

## Personal Reflection

Reflecting on my own experiences, I can clearly see how my Adventurer personality influences my work life. There have been times when I've felt out of place in highly structured, repetitive work environments. I've struggled with the stability that many people seek, often feeling restless and unfulfilled.

What I truly desire is freedom – the freedom to express myself, to choose where and how I work, and to contribute to projects that align with my values and interests. I've found that I have a hard time following strict routines, rules, or deadlines, which can sometimes be perceived as a lack of commitment or reliability.

However, understanding my personality type has helped me reframe these traits not as weaknesses, but as unique aspects of who I am. I've learned to appreciate my need for variety and my ability to think outside the box, recognizing that these qualities can be valuable assets in the right work environment.

## Embracing My Uniqueness

Through this journey of self-discovery, I've come to an important realization: I'm not a "bad" employee or colleague – I'm simply unique. Understanding my personality type has given me insight into my strengths and weaknesses, allowing me to approach my career with a new perspective.

As an Adventurer, I bring creativity, adaptability, and a fresh perspective to the workplace. I excel at finding innovative solutions to problems and can easily adapt to changing situations. My empathy and people skills make me a valuable team member, especially in roles that require understanding and connecting with others.

Moving forward, I plan to leverage these strengths in my career. I'll seek out work environments that value creativity and flexibility, where my unique approach can be an asset rather than a hindrance. This might mean exploring freelance opportunities, creative fields, or companies with progressive work cultures that embrace individuality.

At the same time, I'll work on developing strategies to manage my challenges. This could involve using tools to help me stay organized, communicating openly with colleagues about my work style, and finding ways to incorporate structure into my routine without sacrificing my need for freedom.

## Conclusion

Discovering that I'm an Adventurer (ISFP) has been a transformative experience. It's helped me understand why I approach life and work the way I do, and has given me the confidence to embrace my unique qualities.

While being an Adventurer comes with its challenges, particularly in traditional work environments, it also brings numerous strengths. My creativity, adaptability, and genuine approach to relationships are valuable assets that can contribute significantly to both personal and professional success.

Moving forward, I'm excited to continue exploring career paths and work environments that align with my personality. I'm committed to leveraging my strengths while also working on areas where I can improve. Most importantly, I've learned to appreciate my uniqueness and to see it as an advantage rather than a drawback.

This journey of self-discovery has shown me that there's no one-size-fits-all approach to life or work. By understanding and embracing our individual personalities, we can each find our own path to fulfillment and success. For me, that path is one of adventure, creativity, and authenticity – and I'm looking forward to where it will lead.
